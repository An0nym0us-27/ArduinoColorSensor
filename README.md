# ArduinoColorSensor

The purpose of this project is to implement the color sensor on the Arduino uno.

The color sensor works by detecting RGB color frequencys. Depending on your project, you will need to scan the colors you are attempting to detect so that you can more accurately define a range for the color frequency.

In this implementation, I detected red when it was between the frequency of 75-100. A message would be displayed to the serial window notifying the user that red was detected.
